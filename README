2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-std-sato |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |         Y        |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES"'.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

	# cd path_to_project/tmp-glibc/work-shared/xilinx-versal/kernel-source
	# git whatchanged v5.2/standard/wr-base..HEAD


4. Boot Instructions
====================

You must load the DTB (device tree blob) into the target's memory
prior to booting the kernel Image. The DTB file can be found in the export
directory after building a project, or you can generate it manually with the
following commands:

        # bitbake -c devshell virtual/kernel
        # vim arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/versal/the_file_you_edit*.dts[i]
		# make xilinx/versal/system-top.dtb

The resulting DTB file can be found here:
path_to_project/build/tmp-glibc/work/<bsp name>-wrs-linux/linux-yocto/<kernel version>/linux-<bsp name>-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/versal/

Assuming all files can be downloaded from a network, deploy your board and host
properly to ensure your network is available from the board.

4.1 Boot from SD card
---------------------

4.1.1 Deploy kernel, DTB image and file system image into your SD card
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the bootloader/README for information on how to make an SD
bootable card. Deploy the kernel image, DTB image and file system image as follows:

	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/sd
	# tar -C /mnt/sd -jxf wrlinux-image-std-xilinx-versal.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner
	# umount /mnt/sd
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
	# cp path_to_Image /mnt/sd/boot
	# cp path_to_system-top.dtb /mnt/sd/boot
	# umount /mnt/sd

4.1.2 Set the u-boot environment variables and boot from SD card
----------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to load the kernel image and DTB image:

	=> setenv bootargs console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait earlycon=pl011,mmio32,0xFF000000,115200n8 clk_ignore_unused
	=> mmc rescan
	=> fatload mmc 0 0x10000000 system-top.dtb
	=> fatload mmc 0 0x11800000 Image
	=> booti 0x11800000 - 0x10000000

4.2 NFS boot
------------

4.2.1 Setup configuration your NFS TFTP server, and deploy the rootfs tarball
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	# sudo tar jxf wrlinux-image-std-sato-xilinx-versal.tar.bz2 -C path_to_rootfs

4.2.2 Set the u-boot environment variables and boot from NFS
------------------------------------------------------------

	=> setenv bootargs console=ttyAMA0 earlycon=pl011,mmio32,0xFF000000,115200n8 clk_ignore_unused root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=serverip:path_root_rootfs ip=dhcp
	=> tftpboot 0x11800000 Image; tftpboot 0x10000000 system-top.dtb; booti 0x11800000 - 0x10000000


5. Features
===========

5.1 CAN
-------

# configure can0 in the speed of 800000
   $ ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 800000
   $ ip -details link show can0

# send out a single frame
   $ cansend can0 1F334455#1122334455667788
   $ ip link set can0 down

6. kexec and kdump
===================

You need to add feature/kexec support as follow:

	./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines xilinx-versal --templates feature/kexec,feature/kdump

6.1 kexec
---------

	kexec -l  /root/Image.gz --append="`cat /proc/cmdline`"
	kexec -e

6.2 kdump
---------

Add crashkernel=512M to the kernel cmdline
   kexec -p /root/Image.gz --append="$your-bootcmd"
   echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger


7. WIC Notes
============

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-versal/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-versal.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

7.1 An example to deploy bootloader into the first partition
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Deploy the created WIC image into SD card(/dev/sdx) in your host machine.

   $ sudo dd if=wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-versal.wic of=/dev/sdx

2) Download binary bootloader from the vendor website, and deploy BOOT.BIN into
   /dev/sdx1

   $ sudo mount /dev/sdx1 path_to_sdx1
   $ cp -r path_to_your_bootloader/BOOT.BIN path_to_sdx1
   $ sync; sudo umount path_to_sdx1

7.2 Boot the board from the WIC SD card
---------------------------------------

Insert the SD card into the board and power on, then set the proper u-boot
environment parameters to boot the board, please refer to section 4 for more
information.

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile system-top.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x00200000; setenv fdtaddr 0x00001000

=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw console=ttyAMA0 earlycon=pl011,mmio32,0xFF000000,115200n8 clk_ignore_unused rootwait'

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr rootwait'

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;


8. System Monitor
==================

System monitor includes PL monitor and PS monitor.
Each system monitor measures voltage and temperature to provide information and alarms
to other parts of the system including the PMU, RPU, and APU processors.

Customer could check the detail system monitor interfaces with below command:
	# ls -la /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0


9. XRT & Zocl
======

9.1 Introduction
----------------
Xilinx Runtime (XRT) is implemented as as a combination of userspace and kernel
driver components. XRT supports both PCIe based boards like U30, U50, U200,
U250, U280, VCK190 and MPSoC based embedded platforms. XRT provides a
standardized software interface to Xilinx FPGA. The key user APIs are defined in
xrt.h header file.

Zocl kernel module provides the ioctl interfaces for interacting with Xilinx
FPGA platforms(Zynq/ZynqMP/Versal). Main interfaces are infined in zynq_ioctl.h
file.

9.2 Declarations
---------------
XRT and Zocl are not supported by Wind River LTS 19 standard product because of
the license constraints.

User can build, compile and deploy xrt and zocl package or module at their own
responsibility in compliance with any licenses or legal requirements for content
used.

9.3 Instructions for building xrt and zocl.
-------------------------------------------
Since xrt and zocl are not supported by Wind River LTS 19 standard product, the
building of them will end up with build errors.

To build xrt and zocl, you need to add them to the whitelist, add below lines to
conf/local.conf file.
PNWHITELIST_xilinx += 'xrt'
PNWHITELIST_xilinx += 'zocl'

You may also need to enable the network to get their source codes, add below
line to conf/local.conf to enable the network support.
BB_NO_NETWORK = '0'

And if you want to add xrt and zocl module to the final rootfs, you need add
below lines to conf/local.conf file.
IMAGE_INSTALL += "xrt"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "zocl kernel-module-zocl"

9.4 Other liminations
----------------------------
XRT includes source code for ERT firmware. It needs to be compiled with the
MicroBlaze GCC compiler, Well, Wind River build system doesn't support this
compiler, the building of the counterpart codes will be ignored.

To enable the full function of the XRT, user needs to install Xilinx Vitis™
Software Platform and compile the source codes following Xilinx official
guidances, and then copy the firmware files to the deployment system.

Check https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/2021.1/html/build.html for more information.


10. Multilib
============

By default, this BSP is configured as a 64-bit kernel and 64-bit userspace.
If a full 32-bit filesystem is necessary, use the prefix "lib32-" before
the expected target image as follows:

	# bitbake lib32-wrlinux-image-std
